# Culture-of-India

## Introduction
<p>A static web project created using HTML , CSS, Javascript back in 2014. The design of this project came at the verge of helping my brother in his Computer Science project submission :P .
The uniqueness of the project is, not a single third party tool was used. All animations and effects was achived using vanila Javascript.</p>

<p>Being a static web application, just open the index.html page in your browser</p>

## Thanks
Please feel free to fork/ download the project. If you like an area to improve on, please feel free to do so. Help is always appreciated
